Exhibition visual elements list
14.04

Booklets
- Cover (different color for each of the booklets; so far red definitely for Love)
- Content (4 column and 2 column layout for journal?)
- Visualisations:
  - Commit History
  - QR codes for more important links (on the sides or at the end)
“Play thoughtfully, think playfully” on the back of the cover?

Exhibition 
- Stations:
  - Information board that will go on top of the PC screen (so far only 2 PCs for Love and Work) → 55cm width, around 30/35cm height
  - Information board for the rest of the stations (4) tbd. → depends if will be by the wall
  If yes, which will probably be the case for most of them → around 40cm width, 55cm height?
  If not (only for the Phone game probably) → need to think about that but we can potentially use the sides of the station (mentioned below)

- Body → all of the sides will be covered by cardboard pieces (around 70cm width, 100cm height), name of the game + year (and a corresponding symbol from the main timeline?) → the text should be visible but not overwhelming so about 15cm height?, optionally a quote from Pippin’s book or journal (smaller than the game title)

The rest
- Main timeline for all of the games - depends where it will be hung up (probably the bathroom wall in the center of the room - width 2.6m, height 2.5m); needs to be big, at least 100cm width (also, a specific symbol for each of the games?)

- Additional visuals - need to think about this, but definitely a bigger (A3?) poster of “Play thoughtfully, think playfully” and a poster dedicated to Devolution social media (A3?)

- Small posters to show where we are (A4?)

- Banner for the balcony (width 5m, height 1m?)

The Designer Is Present
  - Small info sheet to put in place when Pippin is not there (A4)
  - Poster with info (A3?)

- Worth mentioning: lights for the Love station, projector set up (possibly behind Pippin)

Online
  - Social Media Banner and profile picture avatar
  - Posts for the upcoming exhibition
