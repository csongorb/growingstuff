This is the process documentation for the game *It is as if you were making love* by Pippin Barr. It was produced for the exhibition *Pippin Barr x Devolution: ???* at *A MAZE. / Berlin 2025*.

The document is edited for printing, but stays as close to the original spirit as possible. Archiving is the main purpose, data kept "as is" and not updated.

> 100% a series yes! There are some bits in there where I feel like they end up being a bit about distinct things. I think of *Love* and *Work* as both existing in specific fictional universes where they're "needed" as a kind of therapeutic intervention into a problem. *Chess* didn't really come from that place, was more of a "wouldn't it be funny if...". And then *Phone* is unclear to me right now... I think probably giving it some Speculative Play scaffolding does make a bit of sense, but it feels reactive to exactly *now* rather than the future? So I'm not even sure it works out as speculative at all...^[Barr, P. (2023) The Stuff Games Are Made Of. Cambridge, Massachusetts; London, England: The MIT Press (Playful Thinking). Available at: https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/14495.001.0001.]



Pippin Barr has in parallel invented / worked on *Games as Research* 
and has focused on the idea of *speculative play*.
