The text is edited for print, but stays as close to the original as possible. Exploration of the original material is the main purpose, data is kept "as is" and not updated. See the original [repository](https://github.com/pippinbarr/itisasifyouweremakinglove) for the *real* experience.

The original process documentation was written as a wiki with MDMA already in mind, and only later (2022) uploaded to the same repository. 

> This is the process documentation wiki for the game It is as if you were making love. The process documentation available here is the result of following the [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma) (Method for Design Materialisation and Analysis), an approach to game design recoverability that forms the basis of the [Games as Research](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/) project I am part of with [Rilla Khaled](http://www.rillakhaled.com/) and [Jonathan Lessard](https://jonathanlessard.net/).^[[https://github.com/pippinbarr/itisasifyouweremakinglove/wiki](https://github.com/pippinbarr/itisasifyouweremakinglove/wiki)]
