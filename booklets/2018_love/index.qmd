## A note on the text

The text has been edited for print, but remains as close to the original as possible. Its main purpose is to provide the original material for exploration, the data is preserved *as is* and not updated.

> This is the process documentation wiki for the game *It is as if you were making love*. The process documentation available here is the result of following the [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma) (Method for Design Materialisation and Analysis), an approach to game design recoverability that forms the basis of the [Games as Research](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/) project I am part of with [Rilla Khaled](http://www.rillakhaled.com/) and [Jonathan Lessard](https://jonathanlessard.net/).^[[github.com/pippinbarr/itisasifyouweremakinglove/wiki](https://github.com/pippinbarr/itisasifyouweremakinglove/wiki)]

The original process documentation was written as a wiki with MDMA already in mind, and only later (2022) uploaded to the repository.
