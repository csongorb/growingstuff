## Questions / Todos

### Old notes about the booklet "The Designer Is Present"

- ~~or should it be just: a blank *Designer's Notebook* to emphasise the idea?~~ YES!

This is the booklet meant to accompany *The designer is present*. Many many still open questions:

- what game are we talking about?
- if it's *Phone*: can we consider the new version as a _new_ game (DLC?), or is it a clear continuation of the old one?
   - do we need a new booklet?
   - or should we just add to the old one? just the journal, or also the other parts?
   - maybe its easier if it's a new one...
