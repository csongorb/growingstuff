 - Perhaps I will read this entry in two months and think, ha! Yeah right
 - Why? There’s the comedy value going on in there
 - Obviously this Love game of mine has been suffering from a lack of, well, love and attention
 - I’ve maaaaaybe been overcomplicating how that should work
 - I specifically don’t want to hold back the player in the non-speculative sense, in their not-roleplaying-capacity from ‘getting it’.
 - OKAY. OKAY BUD. OKAY.
 - I think if you do all that you’ll be doing well.

## Questions / Todos

### Old notes about the booklet "The Designer Is Present"

- ~~or should it be just: a blank *Designer's Notebook* to emphasise the idea?~~ YES!

This is the booklet meant to accompany *The designer is present*. Many many still open questions:

- what game are we talking about?
- if it's *Phone*: can we consider the new version as a _new_ game (DLC?), or is it a clear continuation of the old one?
    - do we need a new booklet?
    - or should we just add to the old one? just the journal, or also the other parts?
    - maybe its easier if it's a new one...
