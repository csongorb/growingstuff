	abstract = {The method uses the affordances of Git to track the design process of a project from initial concept through design through development (and iteration) through testing to release, support, and reception. Perhaps most centrally, Git commits are used not just to keep track of technical progress in the implementation of the project, but to track the design thinking behind each “move” made in the project. This is alongside a Process Journal that is used to capture more longform reflections about the project direction as a whole.},

	abstract = {Recent years have borne witness to an explosion of games research from diverse home disciplines. Much of this work concerns game design, but the games research community has yet to agree on practices and methods for examining game design that are simultaneously rigorously scholarly, flexible enough to accommodate a design-oriented perspective, and sufficiently knowledgeable of computation to engage with the materiality of games. In this paper, we outline such an approach. We focus on the question of an appropriate method for an academic game design research practice that is grounded in making and play while respecting recoverability and context. We demonstrate what game analysis based on such a method can reveal, drawing on the case of Pippin Barr’s It is as if you were doing work, and show how method and analysis in tandem can materialise tacit design knowledge, support balanced subjectivity, and illuminate the often abstract design problem space.},
