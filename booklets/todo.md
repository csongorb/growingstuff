# Booklet related todos

## General

- add to all booklets: 
	- when was the content uploaded? versioning!
	- to the end of the commit messages and the journal: check repository for updates
- what to do with the links in the booklets? footnotes?
- the timeline of Todo.md is interesting, almost up to the commit messages, maybe even more... how to show them better?
- make better looking graphs for the commit overview
- make a better looking timeline for *It is as if...*
- displaying "done" todos in a more readable way?
- general preface area needs to be reworked
	- infos & press infos can be much shorter
- maybe: instead of a TOC: something similar to what Pippin usually uses as an info? "read the documentation to..."
- intro: mentioning, that all games were released unter the license...
- ~~adding assets?~~ File Structure!
- ~~adding code?~~ File Structure!

## Only Meta

- how to show that we needed to print before the content is finished?
- should we add messages to Jesse?
- ~~should we add screenshots of the Miro board?~~ Yes!
- should we add the dialogue of the Devolutionizer?

## Only Chess / Paperwork / Text Adventure

- ~~separate them into 3 small booklets? somehow I like the idea to emphasise how everything has developed... not hiding the rough edges~~ Yes, done!
	- is it not part of the idea that chess was only uploaded into a repository later?
	- is it not ok that *Text Adventure* was not finished?

## Only Phone

- ~~merging Why.md into Journal?~~ No!

## Only Love

- (re-)formatting commit messages; Pipping has uses a lot of special characters in the commit messages, they are not looking good if just imported to markdown
- ~~it it right to assume in this case the journal was written in parallel and only added later (2022)? why?~~
	- ~~especially *to-do.md*, misses any commit history to it~~ Done!
- ~~press & info needs to be added~~
- ~~todos were maintained through a wiki: adding different versions from there!~~
- ~~file structure with game & data?~~

## Only Work

- adding screenshot to booklet?
- finding missing images (blog posts)
- restructuring press?
- adding quotes from book & conference paper? or at least mentioning them in the intro? (or in the end?)
- adding social media (images) to press about?
- turning journal the other way around? this seems to be reversed...
