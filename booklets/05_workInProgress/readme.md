# Booklet: It is as if...

## Questions / Todos:

This is the booklet meant to accompany *The designer is present*. Many many still open questions:

- what game are we talking about?
- if it's *Phone*: can we consider the new version as a _new_ game (DLC?), or is it a clear continuation of the old one?
    - do we need a new booklet?
    - or should we just add to the old one? just the journal, or also the other parts?
    - maybe its easier if it's a new one... 
- or should it be just: a blank *Designer's Notebook* to emphasise the idea?
