## Early Questions

Which versions to exhibit for which game? How (PC, phone, tablet?)?

## 2025-04-05 Csongor: First Ideas

Which versions to exhibit? We have the games, but we also need to find the particular versions...

All / most versions will be exhibited through the [Devolutionizer](https://github.com/csongorb/devolutionizer), at least thats the idea. 

Still, lot of open questions:

- can we add the versions directly to this repository? would that be ok? would that work? would Pippin be ok with it?
- can we let people play each version with a QR code?
    - or do we want to let them see the hub and select each version individually?
    - or both (individual solution for each game)

## 2025-04-22 Csongor: Shift & Focus on Player

Time is running short, so instead of making the full Devolutionizer, let's focus on the Player only, thats the core of what we need. 

Made a fast setup, it already makes a strange sense to be able to switch between the versions so fast

The main question I have is: *vertical* or *horizontal*?  
Maybe thats on the exhibition team to answer, but my feeling is *horizontal*, as we want to (?) put a timeline-visualisation on top of the monitors, do we?

Just a small additional ideas / brainstorming:

- I would suggest to differentiate into different files for different things, to make editing (by different people) easier
    - one file for the colors
    - one file for game related info (game title, very maybe horizontal or vertical, etc.)
    - one file for versions related info (folder, name, date, description)
- not sure about the dark mode, as... we want to have different colors for each game
- the transitions between the version are amazing, so much better!
- so cool that the selected version stays visible!
- not sure, but sometimes we might want to have a wrapper for the versions, like for 2018-06-06, as this is not meant to be soooooo wide I suppose

Such things!  
But amazing, let's discuss and brainstorm later together!

## 2025-04-26 Csongor: Yesss!

Dear Haniyeh,  
this is just so cool! Just so happy to see them, it works so well, makes fun to check, to compare.  
Not sure what the others will say, but here some faaast impressions from my side:

- retro is... yeah! but I also feel: 
    - either the design needs to go together with each of the names (Work & Love are great with Win, but Text Adventure? maybe...)
    - or we need something more neutral, fitting the the general style
- for the additional stuff / links: I think if we focus on the exhibition... we don't really need them, as the visitors should look at the booklets, NOT at the original repositories
    - maybe we can make an update after the exhibition?

See you!

Feature request: can you always show the first version after start?
