## A note on the text

This is the *catalogue / curators statement / meta-booklet / process documentation* of the exhibition *Pippin Barr x Devolution: It is as if you were...* at *A MAZE. / Berlin 2025*.

The booklet is based on the repository of the project. As a physical artefact it preserves the state of the project in a certain moment in time, when still far away from being finished. Please visit the repository^[[github.com/csongorb/growingstuff](https://github.com/csongorb/growingstuff)] to see the full (?) design journey and reflections.

The text has been edited for print, but remains as close to the original as possible. Its main purpose is to provide the original material for exploration, the data is preserved *as is* and not updated.

The repository is only a small part of a larger project and does not adequately or equally represent everyone on the team.  Please check the full credits for their amazing contributions^[[github.com/csongorb/growingstuff/blob/main/credits.md](https://github.com/csongorb/growingstuff/blob/main/credits.md)].  
Without you, this would be nothing! ❤️

## It is as if you were...

*It is as if you were...* is an ongoing series of experimental games by Pippin Barr:

```
🌱 It is as if you were/
├── ♟️ playing chess            (2016)/
├── 🖥️ doing work               (2017)/
├── ❤️ making love              (2018)/
├── 📋 doing paperwork          (2022)/
├── ⌨️ playing a text adventure (2024-)/
├── 📱 on your phone            (2025)/
└── 🌸
```

In order to understand the development process of the series, it is important it in the context of a few other events in Pippin Barr's life/career:

- joining the project *Speculative Play*^[[speculativeplay.com](http://www.speculativeplay.com/)] in 2017
- co-publishing the *Games as Research*^[[gamesasresearch.com](https://www.gamesasresearch.com)] website in 2018
- co-publishing a paper about the development process of *It is as if you were doing work* and the idea of MDM^[Khaled, R., Lessard, J., and Barr, P. (2018) ‘Documenting trajectories in design space: A methodology for applied game design research‘, in Proceedings of Foundations of Digital Games (FDG) 2018.] in 2018

> 100% a series yes! There are some bits in there where I feel like they end up being a bit about distinct things. I think of *Love* and *Work* as both existing in specific fictional universes where they're "needed" as a kind of therapeutic intervention into a problem. *Chess* didn't really come from that place, was more of a "wouldn't it be funny if...". And then *Phone* is unclear to me right now... I think probably giving it some Speculative Play scaffolding does make a bit of sense, but it feels reactive to exactly *now* rather than the future? So I'm not even sure it works out as speculative at all...^[See @sec-dialogue]

> I first tried documenting this history in anxious blog entries [...]. Later, I turned to writing lengthy design reflections in private Evernote journals. These days, the process has become much more sophisticated, and it even has a name. I work with what my colleagues and I call MDM, or the Method for Design Materialization^[Khaled, R., Lessard, J., and Barr, P. (2018) ‘Documenting trajectories in design space: A methodology for applied game design research‘, in Proceedings of Foundations of Digital Games (FDG) 2018. & Khaled, R. and Barr, P. (2023) ‘A method for design materialization: Accountable game design research‘. Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) Conference 2023. Seville, Spain. 19-23 June 2023.] .^[Barr, P. (2023) The stuff games are made of. The MIT Press (p. 6-7).]

## The Stuff Devolutions Are Made Of

*Devolution*^[[devolution.online](https://devolution.online/)] is an ongoing artistic and/or design research project aimed at understanding and dissecting the process of game development, encountering new characteristics and features with each new iteration. Historically, *Devolution* began as an exhibition of the development process of selected games. 

The core of each exhibition is a visual timeline of around 6 to 8 playable versions of a game, often including prototypes, in-between or afterrelease states, and dead branches, accompanied by contextual information, developer tours, talks, and discussions. Visitors can explore the timeline and development histories of the games by comparing versions to each other and find interesting aspects on their own.

> For the player... well I continue to like the idea that the game itself (and this series and many of my things) are a kind of vehicle for research by the player at a more controlled level. You play this game and you are, yourself, investigating the nature of shadows in Unity, encouraged to think about and focus on them.^[[github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-5/blob/main/process/journal.md](https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-5/blob/main/process/journal.md)]

> Rather, most of the design work takes place in conversation with stuff. [...] When you’re listening, the stuff games are made of is not quiet, not transparent, and not just there to be used. It’s a close companion, offering up its own ideas about game design all along the way.^[Barr, P. (2023) The stuff games are made of. The MIT Press (p. 5).]

> If the stuff isn’t going to shout, we’ll have to lean in. To make the results accessible, we’ll need ways to explicitly document such design work. It has long been a goal of mine to present a completed video game together with the design history of how it came to be.^[Barr, P. (2023) The stuff games are made of. The MIT Press (p. 6).]
