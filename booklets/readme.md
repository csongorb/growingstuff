**Pippin Barr x Devolution: It is as if you were... an eight booklet bundle**

**Short:**  
A limited edition eight-booklet bundle showing and exploring the development process of the *It is as if...* game series by Pippin Barr.

**Long:**  
Explore the development process of the *It is as if...* game series by Pippin Barr and the corresponding *Pippin Barr x Devolution: It is as if you were...* exhibition through a limited edition bundle of eight hand-made booklets. The booklets pull together journals, correspondences, blog posts, to-do lists, and more to reveal the in-between moments of game design. Find out why Pippin switched to a Windows 95 look and feel for *It is as if you were doing work*, how he decided to cut zen gongs from *It is if you were on your phone*, or how Pippin and Csongor struggled to decide what should happen on stage. Draw your own conclusions, and even branch off to reflect on your own development process.
