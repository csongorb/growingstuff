# Booklets

## Shop Description

 Spare some coin and step into the experimental world of Pippin Barr! Through this 7-booklet bundle we document the design process behind his brain scratching game series It is as if... and the challenges of bringing Devolution to life. Each booklet offers sneak peak into the ideas, iterations, and philosophies that shaped one of the games in the collection. Whether you're a designer, developer, or simply curious about the art of creating meaning through play, this bundle offers a rare behind the scenes glimpse into the making of digital experiments that challenge what games can be.
