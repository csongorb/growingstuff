Initial commit

Initial setup

- Very early html
- Miniature questions like "should there be a menu bar?"
- Looked at Kicker (and thus Inform online) for a basic understanding, but didn't really implement any of that particularly

A very basic framework is in place now

- Two commands, one of which yields point
- A history that will build over time (have to pay attention to it scrolling off the bottom)
- A feeling that this may not be a good solution, just going for total randomness, because it would be kind of hard to tell any kind of a story?
- A feeling I shouldn't overthink this... generating commands with a tracery grammar might be the smartest approach?
- But on the other hand do we want some level of awareness of what's actually around??
- Do I end up secretly creating some part of an actual Inform thing if I do this? Kind of, but also not... maybe I can make a data structure that can generate meaningful and consistent stuff? Kind of like that...

Very basic "procedural" idea working

- But also not working at all really because it blossoms out into extreme complexity the more I think about it?
- Having my doubts about this approach. I think it's doable but things like picking the probablility of specific commands seems daunting having put this little thing together
- BUT I will say that it's for sure really quite satisfying feeling like it works and that there's this (fake-ass) sense of switching locations, picking something up, etc. I think there's something to this overall

Fixed info/

- Embarassingly it was still the Chesses 3 information

Moving over to the linear story

- Reworked the data and the engine to tell a linear story
- Started thinking about the relationship of delays and timing to text
- Thought about the idea of "preactions" and "reactions"... the idea of an expression of anticipation and then a response to whatever command and output you have
- Because the user THINKS ABOUT WHAT TO TYPE and also then REACTS TO THE RESPONSE TO THAT TYPING
- Oh my GOD I need to have typoes
- I'm enjoying this form, but well aware I'm hiding from the real storytelling/writing task
- But when I get there I get there

Styling, flow, lorem ipsum

- Spent time making the style sheet look at least partly "nice" or at least "more like a text adventure" - fixed width font feels like a win somehow, even though I don't think that's the norm?
- Importantly now have the command entered as part of the history which looks right and was one of the things kind of throwing me somehow
- Started thinking about how to write preactions/reactions and noticed that I was being thrown (it's like judo!) by how *short* the placeholders were. I threw in some Lorem ipsum and *that* turned out to be oddly inspiring... the idea of paragraph level texts describing what the player should do unlocks the idea of this being more of a true writing project which I kind of like... a meta story about how to act like you're reading a real story in an IF... it's kind of delightfully fucked up?
- It may turn out to be impossible

A .gitignore for all seasons

- Did this so I can have a secret folder to work in while the story is embargoed
- Important to be able to write freely and with reference to the story so that I can think through writing
- Working on early thinking about how to approach it
