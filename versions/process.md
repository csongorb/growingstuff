# Versions/Player - Process

## Early Questions

Which versions to exhibit for which game? How (PC, phone, tablet?)?

## 2025-04-05 Csongor: First Ideas

Which versions to exhibit? We have the games, but we also need to find the particular versions...

All / most versions will be exhibited through the [Devolutionizer](https://github.com/csongorb/devolutionizer), at least thats the idea. 

Still, lot of open questions:

- can we add the versions directly to this repository? would that be ok? would that work? would Pippin be ok with it?
- can we let people play each version with a QR code?
    - or do we want to let them see the hub and select each version individually?
    - or both (individual solution for each game)

## 2025-04-22 Csongor: Shift & Focus on Player

Time is running short, so instead of making the full Devolutionizer, let's focus on the Player only, thats the core of what we need. 

Made a fast setup, it already makes a strange sense to be able to switch between the versions so fast

The main question I have is: *vertical* or *horizontal*?  
Maybe thats on the exhibition team to answer, but my feeling is *horizontal*, as we want to (?) put a timeline-visualisation on top of the monitors, do we?

Just a small additional ideas / brainstorming:

- I would suggest to differentiate into different files for different things, to make editing (by different people) easier
    - one file for the colors
    - one file for game related info (game title, very maybe horizontal or vertical, etc.)
    - one file for versions related info (folder, name, date, description)
- not sure about the dark mode, as... we want to have different colors for each game
- the transitions between the version are amazing, so much better!
- so cool that the selected version stays visible!
- not sure, but sometimes we might want to have a wrapper for the versions, like for 2018-06-06, as this is not meant to be soooooo wide I suppose

Such things!  
But amazing, let's discuss and brainstorm later together!
