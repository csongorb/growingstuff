## Process

### 2025-04-05 Csongor: First Ideas

Which versions to exhibit? We have the games, but we also need to find the particular versions...

All / most versions will be exhibited through the [Devolutionizer](https://github.com/csongorb/devolutionizer), at least thats the idea. 

Still, lot of open questions:

- can we add the versions directly to this repository? would that be ok? would that work? would Pippin be ok with it?
- can we let people play each version with a QR code?
    - or do we want to let them see the hub and select each version individually?
    - or both (individual solution for each game)
