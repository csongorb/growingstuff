Notes on the novella from various readings.

**These are mostly pastes from the text itself that seemed helpful to understand (I still don't) or seemed like they might be a direct help with my own version of events.**

It’s out of order, chapters, what happens if you read chronologically? Should the text adventure be out of order? How to show it?

Planting seeds. The timer. The size of the space. The echo.

Going to the edge. The manifest. The meteor ite. Rations.

The process of opening the crates. The idea some have done this before but don’t remember. The unexplained phenomena ala the zone

The tent, the vast green field. The changing space. Long times in short times.

The warehouse ceiling above. Beams in the sky.

Your first time inconsistency

Barn on fire. Big events.

What barn?

Building seven.

The dreams are getting weirder. It’s a side effect.

“I’ve had the Barn a few times.”

The waltz. One two three.

The cornerstone building and its site.

Can you still see the roof?

It’s become so impossible so fast.

Not remember how she arrived.

Don’t want to be too far from camp for too long. The manifest suggests.

26 we switch to role names

"We’ve never encountered anyone else”

A vacation compared to the founders.

"There could be another warehouse surrounding this one

"But there’s a bridge. The only way in and out. That part is totally

"Jemima Van Horn, May Zissou, Zeera Babcock, Ariella Lockschitz, Viela
Gashead, Oscillia Ålvarez and Atha Ogera stepped off the old ferry onto
the old wooden docks off Port Sunday”

So now they’re people, going in.

"A baker, a writer, a student, a locksmith, a programmer and a fishing boat
captain…”

O’Hara Bellington
the manor house at the center of
the island

The Manor House / House of Peacocks as a setting

a wide scattering of magnificent
peacocks

a single albino bird

Honeyset

More waltzes

a dining room where a man sits at the back most,
right-hand seat at the head of the table near a fireplace

The stairwell was oddly primitive

almost mine-shaft like stairwell

pressed her two palms on the stone wall.
A rectangle of stone yielded (i.e. a janitor couldn’t get in)

a vast, well lit show-room like space

a
warehouse

O’Hara was unique, in that she was catalytic, one
of five people who made what was drably known as, ‘first contact

By the time you arrive,
we expect that there will be no evidence of a container

“You’ll need to officially change your name as an anchor

“House of Peacocks has been evacuated. Estate gardens are being used to
procure produce.” “The Ara Depvishara has been moored at Port Sunday
and is currently, and temporarily, housing the entire estate’s service staff,
as well as eight peacocks. Farnsworth, the white peacock, is still at large.”

“No.” Said Ålvarez firmly. “I don’t think they’re going to find us here.”
