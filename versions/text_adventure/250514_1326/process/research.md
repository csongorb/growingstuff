### Notes from Cornerstone and the manor

#### People

- O'Hara Bellington / O'Hara Jasmine Esthbridge. (visiting?)
- Honeyset
- Ogera
- A man

#### To the manor house from Port Sunday

> walked along the pristine wooden dock of Port Sunday and strolled up the sandy, rocky incline and into the tree line

> Through some overgrown vines

> strode through and along the path towards the manor house at the center of the island

> The homestead, flanked by lush and well kept gardens, at least once she was inside the high walls of the boundary and free of the wild vines of the outer edges of the property, was open to the pristine skies via long sight-lines across the lavish estate in every direction from the main house

> from dirt to grass and then onto the tiled pathway leading up to the front doors of House of Peacock

> Across the lawns, true to its name, a wide scattering of magnificent peacocks. Some a rich sapphire, some splashed with dark emerald plumage, and a single albino bird

> the lawns beside a towering square hedge

> A collection of orchestral waltzes [is playing]

> the entrance hall

> past a dining room where a man sits at the back most, right-hand seat at the head of the table near a fireplace

> Through a short hallway and around a corner, Ogera disappears into a doorway and the echoing sound of high heels on stone emerge from the blind spot

> into the doorway and down the stairs

> The stairwell was oddly primitive in comparison to the classical, picturesque and extravagant house and grounds

> dimly lit, plain concrete in a concrete prism, stretching down into the earth, almost mine-shaft like stairwell. It smelled of stone, dry, with an almost washing powder-like scent, or more the smell of the subway from a grate at street level

> standing at the last landing

> she pressed her two palms on the stone wall. A rectangle of stone yielded and clicked in place a few centimeters into the wall, sliding silently and effortlessly sideways and out of sight.

> Light spilled into the stairwell, revealing a vast, well lit show-room like space. Strings of stadium lighting suspended from the roof, and reinforced walls similar to the interior of a factory; metal beams criss-crossed between great steel pillars

> the angular shapes of the space converged at a central structure, all the lights seemingly pointed at it, like it was an exhibit. Sizing-up the structure gave O’Hara serious pause, as it played with her sense of scale, and the scale of the room. She hadn’t felt as if she had walked far enough down for such a space to be feasibly underneath House of Peacocks, though, it wasn’t impossible, she thought, it was the structure that was throwing her off. From far away it seemed difficult to measure, the light, the winding echoes still in her ear, she walked towards it, and with each step, it seemed to shrink more and more into a graspable size; a kind of oversized diorama, a half, or quarter scale building to what it should have been, that kind of building; a warehouse.

> The kind of structure you see by a dockyard, in an industrial district, a kind of oversized boat house, though, that was more the scale of it, she realized, as she was standing feet away from it.

> This is the idea that was built, though, those that built it have not seen it from this perspective

> “Not that it looks like this at all,” Intervened Ogera. “This is a warehouse, but not quite The Warehouse, the two aren’t quite...”

> O’Hara glanced up and down, the roof awning of The Warehouse only a few feet above her head

> It seemed unlikely that construction could begin once the thing was already built, however, we’ve come to discover that the opposite is true. While it was never our intention to do more than what you and your companions told us to do, it now seems necessary, if we are in fact to do what it is that we set out to do in the first place

> Best to not think of it as an interior and more, a location

> By the time you arrive, we expect that there will be no evidence of a container, but you need to have a bubble to pop a bubble

#### Evacuation

> House of Peacocks has been evacuated. Estate gardens are being used to procure produce.” “The Ara Depvishara has been moored at Port Sunday and is currently, and temporarily, housing the entire estate’s service staff, as well as eight peacocks. Farnsworth, the white peacock, is still at large


## Housekeeper

### Notes from websites about housekeepers

> To run a Manor House, you need discipline. Discipline is very important.

Telling people what to do and when to do it.

> Working with Mr Edgar the butler, Mrs Davies is in charge of the servants

So the Butler could be an important figure if we want him to be. I mean *he* could be the person interested in the basement actually.

> She's also the person they come to if they're feeling unwell. A housekeeper would be expected to know rudimentary first aid and distil simple remedies

So medicine.

> organisation and distribution of all the household linen and china

A task.

> As Housekeeper you must be accountant, diplomat and task master all rolled into one

Their succinct description.

### Stuff from the Regency Housekeeper one

The idea of having been given gifts by the family; could be an item to feature.

In the big houses the Housekeeper is very manager, not a ton of hands-on stuff, which may not suit me. Need to read the book again a bit to get a sense of this.

Having contacts for people for specific jobs and odd jobs.

Arranging for things. If the lord/lady needed a special pair of gloves or food etc. the Housekeeper would be the one sourcing and obtaining it

Ordering stuff, finances, keeping the house stores up etc.
