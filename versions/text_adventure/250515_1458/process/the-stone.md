# The Stone

## 2025-04-28

I am not trying to solve this right as I write this, I am creating a document in which to pursue the Stone I need to make Stony. What is the stone? Victor, what the fuck is the stone?

Not kidding. What is the Stone?

I think it's partly okay if the stone is about making more apparent how a story can be told or experienced as a one-sided phonecall, except through actions taken and personal responses and anticipations of those actions. That is, the sort of meta-project of this thing.

Within the story that I'm trying to create itself I think stone is more like the understanding that big powerful and mysterious narratives can take place near more peripheral people who never truly get involved, but are still part of the weird implied fabric of that story. The stoniness is about how everything is a story? Or rather everything is happening at the same time whether it's dramatically/narratively important or not. 

Perhaps. That's an easy way out because there's a sense in which I don't need to worry about it. But maybe I do because it's a question of how I concertedly work to communicate this through language. I dunno, this is my first time out Shkovskying explicitly.
