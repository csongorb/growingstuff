# Structure

As in the acts.

### 2025-04-22 (From journal)

1. Basic job requirements; the project

We carry out standard janitorial (or other services). We learn about the house and its maintenance, but also about the potential strangeness in the basement. 

Puzzles around getting your job done, but perhaps also noticing things for later (when you want to learn more about the house and the basement and the project)

2. The basement / the peacocks / the white peacock.

Rising action begins when people go down to the basement and we witness that somehow. A feeling. We are curious but cannot find out what was in there, the wall is close. Driving a desire to know what's happening, searching the house for clues and scraps (using janitorial status to access places)

Puzzles around trying (and failing) to get into the basement? Revisiting locations and puzzles to get at more detailed stuff (a kind of spy game)

3. Evacuation.

Climax being the need to evacuate, time limited tasks?, things to get done for safety.

Puzzles around gathering the peacocks together (there are 8) and not finding the white peacock.

4. Port Sunday.

A kind of post-script element in Port Sunday with a specific cast of characters around that you perhaps talk to "ask X about Y"; with an eye to understanding what's going on at the manor. A boat, some remnant of people from the book.

Puzzles around knowing what to ask of who, the boat?

5. Death.

Maybe a final act return to the manor and some kind of very ambiguous death/dissolution?

### 2025-04-23

Okay so the above structure really helped me at least feel like there was a something here. Let's do it again with the Housekeeper in mind and a few more potential details filling in? And with some thought about what the Big Thing is within the acts? Specifically:

- What's it *about*? Overall.
- What is the stone we're making stony? (In the story.)

1. The Housekeeper

An introduction to your role and place in the manor, learning who you are through an initial text and then figuring out your role through simple action with low-key puzzles (just find that item and so on).

The to-do list as a possible starting object that helps you orient yourself to what needs to happen. Driving exploration of the manor, finding specific items (duster, cloth, keys (perhaps you already have those), whatever), solving simple problems.

The idea of "noticing things for later" because the exploration takes you through a lot of the house and ideally past/near things that will become relevant later on. But also maybe gating some decent amount of the house so that there are new things to encounter later on. Funny how much of this really standard game design is coming up because I'm trying to make something that will sort of scan as a real game (and the whole time the specter of: nobody will actually play this and nobody will be able to tell how much work went into this).

The idea of a final task unlocking after the to-do list is complete (parallel puzzles followed by a final puzzle unlocking that we can use to drive into the next act).

The final task could most obviously unlock some awareness of the basement? How much do I want to centralize the basement versus just have it be peripheral/fun? Like is the basement the driving force (however unknown it is) or is the driving force something else?

It's too fun not to make the basement central, right?

(As I write this I find myself seriously pondering making the real game of this afterwards which is... hilarious? Stupid? Unlikely? Great?)

End of act 1 could also be the discovery in the Housekeeper's bedroom of a whole bunch of stuff about the basement we've maybe had hinted up to now. That seems pretty fair. (See other writing about this end of act 2 below)

2. The Basement? / The Warehouse?

Rising action is then the awareness of "there's something going on in the basement" that we want to know about. Why didn't we *already* know about it? There would have been substantial rennovations? Why do we care about it *now*?

But why do we want to know about it now? Because it is, fundamentally *our house*, we are the *house keeper*. Maybe we don't need to motivate this at the level of character in the end because the player will drive towards this regardless - they will be drawn (and forced) toward the mystery as necessary. They investigate because they can investigate and because it's interesting.

A text adventure doesn't *have* to dictate the feelings of the main character.

Possible: at some point you get back to your bedroom and uncover *your own notes* about the Basement. Oh yeah I quite like that. That's a way to have pre-built curiosity in the character + a nice information source and further planning. That could be the end of act 1.

You know, this act could also end with you getting *in* to the basement and very briefly witnessing the warehouse in the space, being tripped out, and fainting/passing out/being rendered unconscious forcefully, to make up in act 3? Not the worst dramatic beat. (I'm also now finding myself thinking like - oh, yeah, I'll write my *own* novella alongside Michael's, haha. Bring on the Netflix series bro.)

HOWEVER... what the fuck actually happens *during* this act. I understand the way *in* (discovering the cache of stuff in the room) and on the way *out* (getting into the basement), but the during?

Well actually that kind of answers the question. It's about figuring out how to get into the basement and executing the plan. Collecting items. Combining items. Maybe discovering a path that works for getting there. Maybe even some kind of timing puzzle around following somebody in at the right time (since that would seem to be the only way you could *really* do it unless we want to get sci-fi hacker about stealing the lady of the house's handprints somehow? Not impossible).

Yeah so that's looking solid actually. All good. Goodsies. Or not. I mean we could also do a thing where you *don't* see the Warehouse... or you see it through the door and are kind of knocked back by the Warehouse in that moment? (Though then what would that say about the Lady? Don't want to get too far into sciencing out my own path through what the fuck is going on?) It is too weirdly disappointing if you never see the Warehouse in the game?

3. Evacuation

The kind of climactic stuff is then not around being in the Warehouse or even near it, but about the evacuation of the manor because of what happened with the Warehouse, or what might happen with it (I need to re-read to get a better sense of the evacuation, but it's clear it was a big moment, including getting the peacocks out... this is all stuff that happens late in the novella which I like too).

Could be interesting to have this almost feel for a moment like a reset. Like you find a to-do list again etc. But this time it's evacuating the manor. There are "obvious" organizational and housekeepery things that you would need to do here. Are you trying to preserve your information about the basement though as well? In what way would that be a challenge though?

Rounding up the peacocks is a thing, but it's also a thing the groundskeeper would need to do. But perhaps you can discover the issue and track him down as a key beat that gets you outside (maybe you see a peacock out the window) but also threads you into the original novella as well.

Finding people and informing them they need to leave and what they need to do is a possible thing. Assigning them their responsibilities. Fetching very specific things in the house (maybe even Warehouse-relevant things). Maybe there's an odd beat where you've become a more trusted entity in the manor when it comes to things related to the basement event, by dint of having seen it and with the Lady not wanting to murder you? Getting a bit sassy with the plot.

So there are things that could "easily" drive actions, but it's a bit less clear how it simultaneously drives "the thing" this is all about. The stony stone?

4. Port Sunday

I think it's about here, in falling action (or, frankly, in the climax), where I really really need to know what the point of all this is for the Housekeeper specifically. Why did they want to know about this stuff in the first place? Having them be a spy or whatever feels too stupid. But are they just a busybody? That's kind of acceptable in a weird way, but what are the stakes at that point?

Anyway this falling action is post evacuation. In my Janitor version this involves the boat specifically as a site to explore and understand with vestiges and other elements about the project kind of left behind (too careless?).

I also had notes about the idea of this being a kind of "talk to X about Y" moment potentially. Again I think more and more it would be nice to have no overlap of characters at all, so that it's all kind of hearsay and confused as to what's maybe going on. (It also seems to me that this could be something we're trying to do throughout, but perhaps it's funny if this is the final opportunity where we don't have our other duties as we can chat?)

It has a kind of one-room murder mystery vibe to it which I think is kind of fun and appealing. A game genre on its own. (Could each act be its own game genre - well within the text adventure confines? Why is this ballooning outwards? Partly because I don't know what I'm doing.)

There's also just something hilarious about the one-sided conversation. I think I already wrote that somewhere. The whole thing is like a one-sided phone conversation and this would make it extra literal.

I think this works? But it will only be really unlocked when I work out the Thing. The Stone.

5. Death? The White Peacock?

Stealing this from the original just because Death is such a powerful ending, but it doesn't have to be that, we could cut to black or freezeframe before we understand what has happened.

Most obviously, as above with the Janitor Run we could have the Housekeeper return or try to return to the manor. Perhaps bear witness to one last thing.

This depends on the Stony Stone again.

## 2025-05-15

Let's sort of try to go through the structure again, and try to figure out what's missing (though I know a big part of it is the architectural/floorplan kind of part of things).

1. Housekeeper

Wakes up in the morning in bed. (Is this too much of a cliche, or is this actually a useful device for orienting the player?)

> Get up. Get dressed. Gather items from the bedroom. Most obviously a set of keys. 

What else would a housekeeper carry around? We're imagining this Housekeeper as live-in but not having a whole shit ton of staff they manage, so they'd be more engaged in practical tasks rather than delegating.

> Breakfast?

This feels very plot-irrelevant, but it's also something a person would actually do. Maybe you can be distracted by stuff and not end up eating breakfast? But it's weird not to eat breakfast. But then it's weird not to go wash your face and stuff, how much of this deeply prosaic stuff about being a Housekeeper makes sense? There's a thing here about how the domestic setting (and the domestic labour setting in particular?) really foregrounds things that we think of as profoundly boring or just unseen? Is there a way to think about making that stone stony? A kind of what? Loving work? But that just feels like a gross repetition of fantasies from novels about happy servants and so on, so perhaps not. Maybe the stoniness would be more about a kind of puncturing of that, or a different angle - not necessarily total hatred, but a kind of highly intelligent thinking about it? And. I'm spiraling a bit though. Maybe just...

Actually also though: in an adventure game you don't necessarily do *every available action*, there's of course a critical path but as you can see in walkthroughs it's not necessarily the case that it's super long and details - a lot of it is just figuring out what to do. So I could afford to be a bit more lean right? So maybe that's something. But also

> Open the door, go to the Breakfast room

The Butler has already made breakfast so you can just sit and eat - I'm very aware of how uncomfortable I am with the Housekeeper being a woman and needing to make breakfast for a man... it could be a different kind of household where the Housekeeper is a man and the Butler a woman, or any other kind of configuration, don't have to have genders - but it will be pretty hard to communicate that so safer to assume assumptions and focus on what I can do through action)

> Sit at the table. Breakfast with the Butler. Talk to the Butler about things. Look at the Butler etc.

That way we can pre-figuring meeting the Butler again later on when it is potentially *them* who reveals directly or indirectly the basement stuff... a whole kind of red-string moment? Maybe some conversation along the lines of "ask butler about x" here is useful

[There's a sense here for me of scripting a film - text adventure inputs as the core directions of a film script - very basic...]

> Start on to-do list

So there's a kind of "breakfast first" directive implied here... because otherwise you can't meet the Butler to talk about stuff and prefigure him or his room etc... maybe he can say some saucy/secretive things.

The to-do list can just be three things for the start let's say? Maybe the final thing requires something from the Butler so that you end up checking for him in his room. This can all just happen in a relatively short period in the morning so we don't have to worry to much about house rhythms? Maybe just before breakfast for the family which would presumably be later that the servants' breakfast?

So the to-do list would involve going to a couple of different rooms? Although if the family is still maybe just getting up etc. it may not be possible to go into their rooms, but maybe that's what we do later on actually, so that could work. So that you can go into their rooms to find out about stuff?

> Setting out breakfast stuff for the family (make tea, toast, fruit... I don't know what the fuck the owners of a Manor house would eat? I don't need to keep setting this in the deep past... it's a contemporary kind of a thing so the breakfast can be correspondingly newer... Soylent! Ha, not really... but actually maybe a shake of some kind makes sense...) So actually

> Making a breakfast smoothie and leaving it somewhere (scintillanting activity -- is it possible to punch this kind of thing up? Or it's just a few commands and no huge deal?)

> Checking the fridge/pantry for things that might be missing?
> Doing the accounts (unclear how to represent that in text adventuring?)
> I mean, dusting is always fun... maybe there's a room that's on the rota for being dusted/attended to? Maybe some special object(s)
> Watering plants (this one is actually nice, I think this one can work because it's multi-room, caring, physical, sensory...)
> And then something you end up needing the Butler for... maybe you notice something he would normally need to attend to so you go to fetch him...?

> Going to the Butler's room (to find him)

So you obviously have to find the room, but that's fine you would know and we can just go there with the command.

> Discovering he's not there but seeing something out of place that makes you pause and linger? Really though a game player needs to excuse to linger in any space, they are always invited... rude

> Studying the thing... could we be as hilariously obvious as to have a corkboard and red string that he would normally hide but has had to leave out because... something, he got called away

And that would be the end of that sequence (will the game itself have these act breaks? I think it won't - but perhaps it would be nice if it did? Colour change? Bit cheeky). So then you're on to act 2 and actively thinking about and ultimately going down the stairs to the basement...
