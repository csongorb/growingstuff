# Script

I guess this is where I will try to write a script of actions and notes that become the script for the game itself? Good luck, me!

## 1: Housekeeper

Some kind of preaction that suggests getting started. What do I do when I start playing a game? Sigh? World weary sigh? (Should I be trying, very very oddly, to imagine a fuller character for the person playing the game as well? Someone for them to perform as... someone with a particular attitude/relationship to deciding to play this game, someone who has had a day and a life prior to this moment? Am I slowly going insane though?)

*Sigh.*

> look

Do I have post-reactions? Should I distinguish them? Does that really make sense? No not really because... well do I need some kind of moment that implies they're reading the descriptive text the game would have output? (Holy shit how much does doing this kind of documentation slow me down versus help me? Imagine just making a game without also writing "everything" down? This is getting very meta. Too meta? There is a screen and a stream of this screen.)

*Blink and look up briefly.*

> open drawer

Just some sort of action that then leads to needing to get out of bed, to sort of gesture at the idea that it's a text adventure with all those stupid "you have to get out of bed first!" things. Although are contemporary games more like "(First getting out of bed)..."? But is this a contemporary game? And if you do that stuff it's completely invisible in this format so better to be explicit once and then maybe not do that idea more than once? Not that I want to formalize that but you know.

*Nod.*

> get out of bod

Haha typos so funny. Not to be overused, I'm just putting it here to remind myself of the possibility.

*Wince.*

> get out of bed

Okay, so now you're the Housekeeper (just Housekeeper? I think perhaps yes given Michael's approach even though it's different and this actual person wouldn't be part of that naming convention) standing in your bedroom in the morning.

Do the pre-reaction/things need to be purely performative or can they also somehow be some whole other thing? These are the ramblings of somebody who is yet to make the stone stony though eh? Or who is anxious that the core idea/conceit/thing here isn't enough. Better to make the simple version and then try stuff if it seems like it's needed later?

Also in a different direction, you don't *have* to have a reaction for every single thing either. So maybe try out not. Notting.

> look at desk

> get keys

> read to-do list

*Breathe slowly and calmly. Your eyes scan the screen.*

> get letter

> look

> look at mirror

> open door

Well I got to here. So the idea being you just are getting up finding your keys, a couple of other things, and then you would head out into the day. It's such a cliche to start the game with you in bed though -- but it also makes sense because it helpfully doesn't as directly imply a whole lot of earlier stuff (though of course you did stuff before you went to bed)... it's like a mini-amnesia. Sweet amnesia.

But for instance now what.. do we have to go and eat breakfast and so on?? Do I get mired in weird details that don't feel all that relevant? Do I need to solve this? Do I just power my way through it? Do I need a slightly higher level set of things that need to happen in the act, that I can then command-line my way towards? Probably? Probably.
