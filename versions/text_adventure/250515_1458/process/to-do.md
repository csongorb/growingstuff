# To-do

- **Bascally fine** ~~Fix it so that the history of commands shows up like a normal IF~~
- ~~Do enough styling so it looks like an IF instead of a piece of shit~~
- Probably not this, even with Lorem ipsum I'm kind of sold on the idea that there's a way to write something here ~~Consider some kind of styling that looks more like text and the *contains* the preaction and reactions? Some way to fill the space out a bit more?~~
- Yes I do want to ~~Or do I want to write more extensively? Is there a writing opportunity here to say more at a meta level...~~
- For now I think that it's better NOT to have timing introduced ~~Work on the time of pre and re actions as well as the command, give it a more natural flow, consider the relationship of delays to storytelling~~
- **What did I even mean by this? Not clear.** ~~Write one scene (paragraph-level preactions)~~

- See what happens if you just write a series of commands and pre/post-reactions that take the house keeper around the house for act 1. Not to really nail it down but to have something in the build more than placeholder, and to experience what it's like.
