In The ~~Artist~~Designer is Present, I perform every day for ~~three months~~two days. The performance is really about presence *and speculative play and developing some new iterations for an **It is as if you were...** games*. You have to be in the here and now, 100 percent.

~~I have the empty chair, so~~ everybody from the audience can come on his free time and ~~sit in the front of me, and~~ engage in this kind of ~~silence, experience of the~~ here and now, the present moment.

So you can observe this as a kind of stage for experience. Or you can really enter that space and take active participation, which actually bring you much closer to the artist, and this presence, and to your own experience.

~~If you sit on this chair opposite of me, it's extremely important to actually find a very comfortable position and you don't move. Just sit motionless, and~~ see what happen if we connect with our eyes. And I really think that it’s going to be something quite special to go into this unknown territory.

Because the energy coming from the audience I have to be transmitter and receiver in the same time; that energy just goes through me. ~~And to be ready for the next visitor and the next one and the next one.~~ *But maybe I will just be there and design a game.*

An experimental session: half performance, half a talk, half a discussion, half live development, half workshop. It will somehow contain glimpses of Pippin Barrs ideas flowing into his games, might contain parts of developing ideas together with the audience, for sure including some reflections on the stuff games are made of and how they influence the development process. Three voices merging into an experience (at least for them). Or also for you?

## Devolution Exhibition - Pippin Barr: It is as if you were...

The exhibition focuses on the development process of the *It is as if you were...* games of Pippin Barr by displaying several games of the series, incl. in-between versions, from early prototypes to later iterations. Visitors can explore the creative process behind the development, encountering new insights with each version they play and each comparison they make. 

Looking at games and game development from the perspective of Devolution lets the visitors discover new and inspiring aspects of how games are growing into shape and what this means for game design and development and digital media in general. In contrast to the usual reception of the finished end result, Devolution reveals the whole road up to them, providing valuable insights to the visitors.

The exhibition is the core of [*Pippin Barr x Devolution: It is as if you were...*](https://github.com/csongorb/growingstuff), a cooperation between [Pippin Barr](https://pippinbarr.com/), [Devolution](https://devolution.online/), A MAZE. / Berlin 2025 and [UE University of Europe for Applied Sciences](https://www.ue-germany.com).
