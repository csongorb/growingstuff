## 2025-03-05 Csongor: Too much changes on one day... need to commit!

Let's just start with this first short reminder that we need to start working on the booklets. And by *we* I mean me / us (the Devolution team). All this restructuring has taken some time... and I don't want to make the mistake of not committing my changes. And I will be working on a different computer tomorrow. 

But you can already see some ideas in the folder structure.

## 2025-03-17 Csongor: Quatro

I'm not 100% sure this is the right direction, but I feel we need to come up with a good pipeline for designing & printing the booklets... we've already done a lot of research, which was good, but the structure is a mess. Ultimately we'll need PDFs / InDesign for the layout, but to get the content together we need something that works in a repository (and maybe with markdown files as they are our source material).

I have been testing a few things over the last few days / weeks... lets go with [Quatro](https://quarto.org/). Yes, I could have chosen another one, but this seems to be a good compromise between a lot of things.

Took a look at some of this stuff! This is possibly more your area of expertise than mind. Quatro seems pretty reasonable to me?
