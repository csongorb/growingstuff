# Booklets

## 2025-03-05 Csongor: Too much changes on one day... need to commit!

Let's just start with this first short reminder that we need to start working on the booklets. And by *we* I mean me / us (the Devolution team). All this restructuring has taken some time... and I don't want to make the mistake of not committing my changes. And I will be working on a different computer tomorrow. 

But you can already see some ideas in the folder structure.
