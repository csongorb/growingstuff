## 2025-03-05 Csongor: Clash?

Maybe I'm too fast with me spreading out the conversations into different files, but I felt we need to start to talk about what might happen on stage and live during the exhibition. 

> was in Albuquerque giving a talk at the [ARTSLab](https://film.unm.edu/facilities/artslab/) at the University of New Mexico which included some reflections on the *It is as if* series and ended up with a little bit about *Phone* and even *Person*. 

One of the things that makes me so excited about this issue of Devolution - besides the fact that it's you! - is the opportunity to do more than the routine of the last few issues, more than a post mortem. To be able to reflect not just indirectly but more directly on how games *grow* out of the *stuff they are made of*. Any chance you could include that?

If you have a short description of your talk at the ARTSLab, feel free to add it to [../onstage/readme.md](../onstage/readme.md). We can expand it from there.

We have about 45-60 minutes of stage time in total, so what do we do with the rest?   
I have two suggestions, would be curious to hear what you think:

Either: another talk that expands the idea, shows a new POV on the same topics. I don't have any particular names in mind, but I'm sure we can find someone great.  
Or: we interview / discuss with each other. In general, I don't like the idea of putting myself on stage too much, I usually try to avoid that. But I see this more and more as an intersection, so it could work. And we would only have a few minutes, so if it goes wrong, it will be over fast.

## 2025-03-28 Pippin: Years later

Years later I reply.

I feel like me doing that existing talk won't reeeeaally be a fit? I mean it's a good talk and I think fairly entertaining... but not necessarily on target in terms of our objectives with the exhibition? If we want an "easy" "Pippin just talks about his work" kind of a thing, I have that locked and loaded, so maybe that's vaguely reassuring.

However... I do kind of like the idea of us talking? Maybe with a third as you mentioned somewhere I think? Though if you're not too excited about being on stage I'm not going to be the one to put pressure on you about it. But it could be kind of nice... an open conversation about design processes from our perspectives? With some visual aids - I can rifle through process documentation, profile MDM, you can talk about game gardens and devolution? Feels like there should be a lot of material in there to just... talk? (Without veering into that terrible version of presentation where people just show up unprepared and it's all janky?)

And I suppose as some sort of third option I could try to concoct a talk that's more grounded in process and MDM... I don't have a *good* talk loaded up like that. I did quite an extensive one about *v r 5* but... I don't think it landed in a good way. It was a bit stiff and boring. I'd have to return to the drawing board to think about how to make something like that a bit lighter and funnier...

So what do you think?

- Pippin does the classics! (Not too related to devolution, more just a recap of 14 years of making games + themes)
- Pippin and Csongor talk process and making design visible
- Pippin comes up with some sort of process talk and just delivers that, maybe a shorter one and you and I have some conversation afterwards to activate it a bit more and fold into a talk with the audience

Do we need to sound exciting? Could we be humiliated and nobody comes? :)

## 2025-04-1 Pippin: Post-meeting

Just want to plant a tiny flag here after our meeting this morning and including Zoewi's (in this exact moment I'm like... is that how I should write her name??) ideas.

Seems like "Pippin does the classics" is a no, which I'm good with.

Feels like Pippin and Csongor chat is good, especially if we can add another voice.

And my immediate thought for a structure (please edit, riff) is something like:

- Pippin talks about a design exercise in relation to some stuff he does. I'm thinking in the immediate term about one version of the "variations" idea as in PONGS, BREAKSOUT, SNAKISMS, SNAKISTS, etc. all capitalized, huh. The objective would be to have audience thinking about the relationship between ideas kind of taken from elsewhere (the dictionary, say) and the language of a game... and what happens when you push them together over and over again.
- Audience does this work with a specific example. We pick a game form (something simple, maybe prechosen to make it easier) and we pick a means to get ideas from elsewhere (a dictionary, an encyclopedia, random youtube videos, whatever) and then people call out one line game designs or something.
- Maybe we even pick a couple and explore them further down into a design process. Obviously we're not going to actually implement anything but we can think more seriously about the implications and fit to the game language and so on.
- And then after we've done that stuff we have a conversation about design process? Maybe Csongor and unspecified guest are involve in this thing at every step? (Mostly wrote myself in to not assign work, but I think it could be more fun if it's an everybody thing?)

There's something slightly unsatisfactory about this for me right now but I can't quite name it. Maybe a bit too chaotic. Not sure. Not sure.

## 2024-04-11 Csongor: The Flag!

Yes, I had the same feeling after the meeting. Lots of good ideas, but no sense of a resolution, no satisfying unity of thought.  

But why is this happening? How do you overcome flags, how do you get to the other side?  
But these are the big questions again, interesting, but we have a puzzle to solve.

Just a few more ideas, thinking out loud:

We could connect on-stage more with *The Designer Is Present*.  
Either by having on-stage at the beginning (of A MAZE.) where you could integrate the audience's input into the design of the game you are working on, by starting to draw ideas! Like an *intro*, the *start*.  
Or the other way around: having on-stage as a looking-back at *The Designer Is Present*, a post mortem, a reflection. In its purest form: you could just sit there and write the journal.

Or we could go in the opposite direction and just make things simpler: three stages (you, us, drawing) is too much for such a short session. Maybe two would be enough / clearer / more focused?

Still no resolution... is this a case where writing is not enough? Let's meet again!
