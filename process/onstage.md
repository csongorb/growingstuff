## 2025-03-05 Csongor: Clash?

Maybe I'm too fast with me spreading out the conversations into different files, but I felt we need to start to talk about what might happen on stage and live during the exhibition. 

> was in Albuquerque giving a talk at the [ARTSLab](https://film.unm.edu/facilities/artslab/) at the University of New Mexico which included some reflections on the *It is as if* series and ended up with a little bit about *Phone* and even *Person*. 

One of the things that makes me so excited about this issue of Devolution - besides the fact that it's you! - is the opportunity to do more than the routine of the last few issues, more than a post mortem. To be able to reflect not just indirectly but more directly on how games *grow* out of the *stuff they are made of*. Any chance you could include that?

If you have a short description of your talk at the ARTSLab, feel free to add it to [../onstage/readme.md](../onstage/readme.md). We can expand it from there.

We have about 45-60 minutes of stage time in total, so what do we do with the rest?   
I have two suggestions, would be curious to hear what you think:

Either: another talk that expands the idea, shows a new POV on the same topics. I don't have any particular names in mind, but I'm sure we can find someone great.  
Or: we interview / discuss with each other. In general, I don't like the idea of putting myself on stage too much, I usually try to avoid that. But I see this more and more as an intersection, so it could work. And we would only have a few minutes, so if it goes wrong, it will be over fast.

Years later I reply.

I feel like me doing that existing talk won't reeeeaally be a fit? I mean it's a good talk and I think fairly entertaining... but not necessarily on target in terms of our objectives with the exhibition? If we want an "easy" "Pippin just talks about his work" kind of a thing, I have that locked and loaded, so maybe that's vaguely reassuring.

However... I do kind of like the idea of us talking? Maybe with a third as you mentioned somewhere I think? Though if you're not too excited about being on stage I'm not going to be the one to put pressure on you about it. But it could be kind of nice... an open conversation about design processes from our perspectives? With some visual aids - I can rifle through process documentation, profile MDM, you can talk about game gardens and devolution? Feels like there should be a lot of material in there to just... talk? (Without veering into that terrible version of presentation where people just show up unprepared and it's all janky?)

And I suppose as some sort of third option I could try to concoct a talk that's more grounded in process and MDM... I don't have a *good* talk loaded up like that. I did quite an extensive one about *v r 5* but... I don't think it landed in a good way. It was a bit stiff and boring. I'd have to return to the drawing board to think about how to make something like that a bit lighter and funnier...

So what do you think?

- Pippin does the classics! (Not too related to devolution, more just a recap of 14 years of making games + themes)
- Pippin and Csongor talk process and making design visible
- Pippin comes up with some sort of process talk and just delivers that, maybe a shorter one and you and I have some conversation afterwards to activate it a bit more and fold into a talk with the audience

Do we need to sound exciting? Could we be humiliated and nobody comes? :)
