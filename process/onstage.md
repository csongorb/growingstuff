## 2025-03-05 Csongor: Clash?

Maybe I'm too fast with me spreading out the conversations into different files, but I felt we need to start to talk about what might happen on stage and live during the exhibition. 

> was in Albuquerque giving a talk at the [ARTSLab](https://film.unm.edu/facilities/artslab/) at the University of New Mexico which included some reflections on the *It is as if* series and ended up with a little bit about *Phone* and even *Person*. 

One of the things that makes me so excited about this issue of Devolution - besides the fact that it's you! - is the opportunity to do more than the routine of the last few issues, more than a post mortem. To be able to reflect not just indirectly but more directly on how games *grow* out of the *stuff they are made of*. Any chance you could include that?

If you have a short description of your talk at the ARTSLab, feel free to add it to [../onstage/readme.md](../onstage/readme.md). We can expand it from there.

We have about 45-60 minutes of stage time in total, so what do we do with the rest?   
I have two suggestions, would be curious to hear what you think:

Either: another talk that expands the idea, shows a new POV on the same topics. I don't have any particular names in mind, but I'm sure we can find someone great.  
Or: we interview / discuss with each other. In general, I don't like the idea of putting myself on stage too much, I usually try to avoid that. But I see this more and more as an intersection, so it could work. And we would only have a few minutes, so if it goes wrong, it will be over fast.
