# Pippin & Devolution 2025

## 2025-01-08 Csongor

Hey Pippin,  
I guess we need to [start it somewhere,  
so le's start it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkpLbEM06qE) here.

Voice would also have been an option, [GAMETHING](https://gamething.life/)-like, but sorry, this somehow feels more natural to me. Also maybe I'm not confident enough with my spoken English, maybe even my voice. Whatever, we can aim for either/or/both in the long run, let's see where this all gets us. 

I'm incredibly happy to have the opportunity to explore and exhibit the development process of one (?) of your games, as you also explore and exhibit the development process of (your) games. In this sense, your work has always been important for Devolution (sorry I got used the use this term for everything related to understanding the development process, but I mean it in a very broad sense), has been crucial in helping us along the way with ideas and inspiration. [Games as Research](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/), [The Stuff Games Are Made Of](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262546119/the-stuff-games-are-made-of/), obviously.

I'm a bit afraid of too much meta-ness, thinking about thinking, exploring explorations, exhibiting exhibitions... but I think we can manage, I just felt I had to mention it once. 

Sorry to start so early with some organisational questions, but we only have 4 months for all this.

Should we focus on the exhibition/ exploration of one of your already finished (whatever that means) games? Which one (well known, last, well preserved/ documented?)?  
Do you maybe have something that is not already on [GitHub](https://github.com/pippinbarr?tab=repositories)?  
Or do we want to showcase one of your ongoing research/ development processes? Are you currently working on something that could be included here? Will you still be working on it during [A MAZE. / Berlin 2025](https://2025.amaze-berlin.de/)? Show how you work, think, search directly in the exhibition, live.  
Or any other ideas?

Looking forward to all this!
Looking forward to whatever you think!

Saw the invitation to this repo in the morning and immediately though *what a good idea*. I love it. Text is more my thing than anything as well - maybe I'm suspicious of my voice too... almost seems like a glamorous paranoia.

Just about to have to make lunch and then devote some time to projects so this is the right moment to quickly get back to you I think.

In short, I think any of the paths you mention can work, but I definitely have this ongoing desire to have it be an *in progress* project in the sense that it might be possible that I could still be working on it when A MAZE rolls around (though frankly ideally not). But even just having worked on a project *with this exhibition in mind* is funny and meta.

So yeah, I just started a project I'm calling *It is as if you were on your phone* which is another installment of my series of speculative future applications along with *It is as if you were playing chess*, *It is as if you were doing work*, and *It is as if you were making love*. This one kind of returns to the chess idea but in a much more generalized sense: it's a simulator of being on your phone. Swiping, tapping, frowing, smirking, mostly being deadfaced. I have this idea (in the docs) that it's this repeated turnaround... the app exists as a kind of cover when you're in public: you look like a nice normal person on their phone. But it's actually a meditative aid, because you're *not* on your phone, you just performing the (soothing?) ritualistic gestures. But actually you *are* on your phone in the end, because... you're on your phone.

I won't go into depth because that's what the game's repo is for, but it might be a fun one. There's a chance it'll be an extended project, too, because I want to make its fraternal twin *It is as if you were on your computer* to go along with it, with the same framework but different base interactions and presumed context. Kind of an "anti boss hotkey" in way?

Anyway it would be my institive preference, but it's subject to a couple of concerns:

- What if I burn out or bore out and don't finish?
- What if it's not very good? (I mean, I'm going to try but who can say this early on)
- What if it's really frustrating for you and us to work on exhibiting something that's perpetually in some kind of flux in realtime?

What do you reckon? I finished *Let's Snake: Ancient Greek Punishment* recently, which is quite well documented, self-contained, fairly amusing...?

## 2025-01-09 Csongor

What a start, thanks for the faaaaaast answer!  
But also: noooooooo! I need to run to a conference, more time please.  
I have so many things I would like to say.

## 2025-01-10 Csongor: Sorting thoughts

Trying to incorporate answering into my routine, it is not really working...

I have always felt that for Devolution, working with *finished* (and already proven *successful*) processes is cheating. Are games ever finished? Are open processes always successful? I would love to see the "flux in realtime"! I want to see the dying branches! 

But I also don't want to pressure you. Do whatever you want, Devolution should not affect the development of your game (at least not in this sense).  
Or is it already? I have some starting *uncertainty principle/ observer effect* vibes.

What if we exhibit/ explore an ongoing process?

What if we focus not on the development of *It is as if you were on your phone* alone, but on the *It is as if...* series as a whole? This would take some of the pressure off you, ease your stress about having to *deliver*... and we could already start some initial preparations on our end (more in-depth research, initial ideas to structur the process).

I have tried to get a first overview of *It is as if...* as if it were one thing, and have already seen a lot of interesting things happening (improvements/ variations in the journaling, more and less living branches, development of the *Games as Research* ideas in parallel, shifting focus):

- [*It is as if you were playing chess*](https://github.com/pippinbarr/it-is-as-if-you-were-playing-chess) (2016)
- [*It is as if you were doing work*](https://github.com/pippinbarr/itisasifyouweredoingwork) (2017)
- [*It is as if you were making love*](https://github.com/pippinbarr/itisasifyouweremakinglove) (2018)
- [*It is as if you were doing paperwork*](https://github.com/pippinbarr/it-is-as-if-you-were-doing-paperwork) (2022)
- [*It is as if you were playing a text adventure*](https://github.com/pippinbarr/it-is-as-if-you-were-playing-a-text-adventure) (2024-)
- [*It is as if you were on your phone*](https://github.com/pippinbarr/it-is-as-if-you-were-on-your-phone) (the plan)
- *It is as if you were on your computer* (the distant plan)

Do you see this all as being one?  
Is it too much for a small exhibition?

And we can also just postpone the final decision to a few weeks later... but in that case we need a backup plan. [*Let's Snake: Ancient Greek Punishment*](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-snake-ancient-greek-punishment) sounds great. I feel [*v r 5*](https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-5) or [*v r $4.99*](https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-4-99) could also work well, especially in an exhibition. That would add another meta layer, but less allow for the idea of live work.

> For the player... well I continue to like the idea that the game itself (and this series and many of my things) are a kind of vehicle for research by the player at a more controlled level. You play this game and you are, yourself, investigating the nature of shadows in Unity, encouraged to think about and focus on them.

No rush no rush! Did a tiny bit of prototyping on the phone game yesterday so it's creeping along. Have started puzzling about it having many different forms and specializations, a whole app ecosystem of different apps for pretending you're doing different things. Rilla (my wife) asked when I was going to make *It is as if you were being a person* which... well in a way the phone game it that, but it did get me thinking about a podcast/album of tracks that offer you in-ear instructions on how to be a person in different contexts. Could make one for A MAZE.

## 2025-01-10 Csongor: Parallel thinking

This all sounds like a potential awesome match. I feel more and more *It is as if...* it is.  
It is as if we would exhibit/ examine an ongoing process.

## 2025-01-13 Pippin: Great minds

Huh, yes I think the idea of a kind of more general *Is is as if* thing could work really well? Gives us plenty of material to work from with the earlier games (including paperwork! ha!). And then also does happen to be the thing I'm devoting my cycles to right now in terms of *It is as if you were on your phone* (did more today), but branching out both into the idea of an "app ecosystem" suite of *It is as if*s for social camouflage (or meditation?? A point of tension for me right now; maybe that should be a "mode"?); and into the idea of *It is as if you were being a person* as a funny "end game" of all this.

So yeah this has legs? "Worst" case we can bomb out into previous work like *Work* and *Love* and *Chess* which have plenty of documentation already alongside the "failed" version of the one I'm doing know. And I can sit in the exhibition space sobbing about my failed project!

Best case it'll be even more complicated!?

## 2025-01-20 Csongor: Serial

(I have to stop talking about this all the time, but) how does time pass so fast, hasn't 2025 just started a few days ago? Anyway, we finished [devolution.online/lmd](https://devolution.online/lmd/), really proud of it. Can / should we aim for online elements in your games? I would love to, although it would again be a first, as your processes are already living online, how can we add to them?

It is inspiring to see you [working](https://github.com/pippinbarr/it-is-as-if-you-were-on-your-phone/commits/main/) and [reflecting](https://github.com/pippinbarr/it-is-as-if-you-were-on-your-phone/blob/main/process/journal.md) next to us... don't feel watched! What does this do to us? I for sure feel strange observing you from a distance.

Give us some time to get an overview of *It is as if...* before we move on to some follow-up questions and possible ideas for working with the processes in the exhibition. How much do you want to be involved in all this? Not only in the development of the game, but also in the exhibition/exploration of the process? Oh, but you already do that... I mean the additional layers? This meta-ness is causing me some troubles. I realise that this time our task is to make things, decisions, reflections *more* visible.

I also have an easier question:  
Do you have by any chance ANY other material about any of the *It is as if...* games that you don't have in your repositories (or in your book?)? I can imagine the answer, but I have to ask...

Do you consider the *It is as if...* games to be a series at all, all coming from the same core? On your website you use the tag **Speculative Play** only for *Work* and *Love* and now *Phone*, but not for the others. Not even for *Chess*, which was a first. Are they for you outside? And what happened to *Adventure*?

Or are they more twins, coming in twos? *Work* & *Love*. *Phone* & *Computer*.

Oh, I have just found this in *The Stuff Games Are Made Of* (p. 61), when you write about *Work*:

> I had decided to call the game *It is as if you were doing work* to bring it under the umbrella of a series of games I was making in which players *pretended* to be doing something on their computer or cellphone rather than “really” doing it. By then, I’d already released *It is as if you were playing chess*, in which you make the gestures and facial expres- sions of a chess player according to instructions on the screen.

So it's a series! So has *Phone* and *Desktop* always lured behind *Work*? And what should *Love* think about that?

## 2025-01-24 Csongor: Devolutionizer

I once wanted to design a chat interface that also visualised the duration of writing. When did it start, how many keystrokes were made, how much was deleted? These overlaps in chats are so interesting, but the interfaces are not able to work with them in a meaningful way.

Anyway, here I am, writing to you, perhaps in parallel.  
I'm thinking about all this because I'm still asking myself how much you want to be involved in our exhibition considerations. Surprising the developers has always been a big part of the beauty of Devolution exhibitions for me, we are taking that away with this. Let me know if this feels like too much, too much detail... and if so, ignore the rest of this message.

And we can move to a more abstract level and talk about research and growth and metaphors.

We don't have sooooooo much space, only for about 4 - 6 screens, with tablets/ phones maybe a bit more. We need to evaluate this further, but that is the tendency. Thinking in *As if* dimensions, that's generally one screen per work.

But how to keep the idea of the timeline more? How to keep the parallelism of versions, as a space to explore, to compare?

I had an idea. Or was it a dream?  
Your *As if* games are the first games we deal with that do not need to be built, but can be played directly from the *raw* data of the repository. This means that we can just easily build something that will check out all (a few selected?) versions of the game, visualise them in some kind of sidebar/ header, so that they can be easily played from there.  
The more I think about it, the more I like it. I know of all the repository analysers and visualisers, but not something like this.  
Ok, yes, you can do it with any git client and an open browser, I know. But I mean a more curated version.  
Will have to let that sink in.

Talking like this feels like *using* your games. I hope you are really ok with all this...

## 2025-01-31 Csongor: Games made of OOP

Oooh, I can't not jump on this:  
[I OOPed in the code pool; I wanna be an FSM (2025-01-28)](https://github.com/pippinbarr/it-is-as-if-you-were-on-your-phone/blob/main/process/journal.md#i-ooped-in-the-code-pool-i-wanna-be-an-fsm-2025-01-28)

I have always felt that the stuff that games are made of is OOP (ok, and as such also data-driven-ness). That it is the structure of the objects that leads the way (how games grow). Objects finding their right place over time, connecting with others, with their environment, eating/ encapsulating each other, morphing. I always wanted to follow up on this, almost in a [Platform Studies](http://platformstudies.com/) kind of way. Or in a *The Stuff Games Are Made Of* kind of way? Is OOP some kind of a natural habitat for (digital) games? Can you go against it?

Did you know that if you search for OOP in your book, all you find are loops?

## 2025-02-01 Csongor: Letterpress

Things are sinking in. I like this phase of understanding more and more, of getting a feeling for the material (what do we have, what are the possibilities), things more and more connecting to each other, slowly building a whole, slowly taking shape. It's almost too fast, need to slow down.

Can we turn your process documentations into booklets?  
Not sure about the extent, we are still reading ourselves into your processes, but some kind of a nicely layouted and designed accompanying material to the versions of the games. Journals, manifestos, the changing todos, maybe extracts from other sources, your texts, other texts. With the booklet for *It is as if you were on your phone* half finished, with blank pages at the end that we can fill as you work on it...

The commit message booklets were always something visitors have enjoyed a lot. This would be a great next step. Opens up nice possibilities for exploration, reading next to checking the versions, comparing, discovering.

And also things like: a limited edition (to sell?).
We have a really nice printing lab at the university, letterpress, offset, flexo, etc. We could do some nice looking covers for all of them, a bundle.

## 2025-02-13 Pippin: 😬

Oh no! We've run into a classic technical hiccup where I wasn't receiving notifications from GitHub telling me this project was being updated with commits. I was just floating around in sweet oblivion like usual.

Although in that time, as you saw, I was putting some pretty decent work into *It is as if you were on your phone* (and have done more stuff this week too). Last week I was in Albuquerque giving a talk at the [ARTSLab](https://film.unm.edu/facilities/artslab/) at the University of New Mexico which included some reflections on the *It is as if* series and ended up with a little bit about *Phone* and even *Person*. So at the very least there's, like, progress happening.

There's a ton of stuff to follow up on here so let me at least try to get to some of it and we keep chatting...

> Can / should we aim for online elements in your games? I would love to, although it would again be a first, as your processes are already living online, how can we add to them?

It was really exciting to return to the latest Devolution project. Funny that they start at the top of the mountain and head down - obviously because of the way the game works, but it's such a fun inversion of the idea of the hardship of climbing the mountain and reaching the pinnacle. Pretty provocative idea that game dev is like kind of coasting downhill... though of course you can go too fast and crash and... well, it's a generative metaphor.

I don't see why we couldn't do some stuff, though yeah not 100% what that might look like. Maybe it's two separate projects?

> How much do you want to be involved in all this?

Haha. I *feel* very involved and am happy to be! Things are pretty intense at work at the moment (being department chair is something I'm more and more used to, but it doesn't quite shift the amount of work it is). I mostly assume I would heavily defer to you on anything exhibition related though - I don't think it's my area, I mostly have it in mind to be as helpful as possible?

> Do you have by any chance ANY other material

Hmmm, I *think* the answer is probably no, but I could be wrong! I mostly tried hard to get all my notebook materials and so on while working on games. I could try to track down my notebooks from around that time, but I've increasingly moved to all digital for design stuff - maybe for the worse? 

> So it's a series! So has *Phone* and *Desktop* always lured behind *Work*? And what should *Love* think about that?

100% a series yes! There are some bits in there where I feel like they end up being a bit about distinct things. I think of *Love* and *Work* as both existing in specific fictional universes where they're "needed" as a kind of therapeutic intervention into a problem. *Chess* didn't really come from that place, was more of a "wouldn't it be funny if...". And then *Phone* is unclear to me right now... I think probably giving it some Speculative Play scaffolding does make a bit of sense, but it feels reactive to exactly *now* rather than the future? So I'm not even sure it works out as speculative at all...

> I had an idea. Or was it a dream?

I think this thinking around being able to (somehow, technical stuff la la) view/slide between different prototypes/versions makes a lot of sense. I suspect they should be curated rather than letting people encounter absolutely any commit, but that seems pretty doable to me... I can imagine at worst a series of cherry-picked commits displayed and you click them and end up playing the game at that state. Conceivably even have the commits visible at the same time if the monitor is big enough etc.

> Is OOP some kind of a natural habitat for (digital) games? Can you go against it?

Yeah this is such an area of interest for me! I have a dream of writing a book/something where it's all about making connections between fundamental elements of programming (loops, variables, OOP, and more) and the ways that videogames work (and don't work?). Kind of like obsessively documenting the "grain" of programming in the context of game design or something? I think it's clear there's something there.

> Can we turn your process documentations into booklets? 

I kind of love this personally. I've been more and more into making little zines just lately so little books are super appealing to me, and there's that funny way they leverage a kind of "seriousness" that something glowing on a screen doesn't have. Would love to explore.

I one was in discussions with a gallerist about trying to produce a limited edition of *The Artist Is Present* as a set of books one listing source code, one with all the assets, etc. Kind of over-the-top "luxury" or something, and also *sort of useless* compared to a repository, but funny to imagine reconsituting a game from books (harks back to the "typing in BASIC programs from a magazine" days - not that I lived through those days).

So yes let's explore? Feels like a nice direction to me. My work is ultimately so driven by *writing* that "books" makes a lot of sense to me.

And merch. I'm so into the idea of "merch" these says. I wear this sweatshirt from Lilith Zone's online store, it's got a texture of *Crypt Underworld* on it. I aspire to have such a great thing emerge from one of my games (my wife Rilla's been designing a t-shirt based on *It is as if you were doing Paperwork*). I connect merch strongly with bands and how much I wish being a game dev was more like being in a band?
