# Pippin & Devolution 2025

## 2025-01-08 Csongor

Hey Pippin,  
I guess we need to [start it somewhere,  
so le's start it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkpLbEM06qE) here.

Voice would also have been an option, [GAMETHING](https://gamething.life/)-like, but sorry, this somehow feels more natural to me. Also maybe I'm not confident enough with my spoken English, maybe even my voice. Whatever, we can aim for either/or/both in the long run, let's see where this all gets us. 

I'm incredibly happy to have the opportunity to explore and exhibit the development process of one (?) of your games, as you also explore and exhibit the development process of (your) games. In this sense, your work has always been important for Devolution (sorry I got used the use this term for everything related to understanding the development process, but I mean it in a very broad sense), has been crucial in helping us along the way with ideas and inspiration. [Games as Research](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/), [The Stuff Games Are Made Of](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262546119/the-stuff-games-are-made-of/), obviously.

I'm a bit afraid of too much meta-ness, thinking about thinking, exploring explorations, exhibiting exhibitions... but I think we can manage, I just felt I had to mention it once. 

Sorry to start so early with some organisational questions, but we only have 4 months for all this.

Should we focus on the exhibition/ exploration of one of your already finished (whatever that means) games? Which one (well known, last, well preserved/ documented?)?  
Do you maybe have something that is not already on [GitHub](https://github.com/pippinbarr?tab=repositories)?  
Or do we want to showcase one of your ongoing research/development processes? Are you currently working on something that could be included here? Will you still be working on it during [A MAZE. / Berlin 2025](https://2025.amaze-berlin.de/)? Show how you work, think, search directly in the exhibition, live.  
Or any other ideas?

Looking forward to all this!
Looking forward to whatever you think!
