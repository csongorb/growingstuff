# Pippin & Devolution 2025

## 2025-01-08 Csongor

Hey Pippin,  
I guess we need to [start it somewhere,  
so le's start it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkpLbEM06qE) here.

Voice would also have been an option, [GAMETHING](https://gamething.life/)-like, but sorry, this somehow feels more natural to me. Also maybe I'm not confident enough with my spoken English, maybe even my voice. Whatever, we can aim for either/or/both in the long run, let's see where this all gets us. 

I'm incredibly happy to have the opportunity to explore and exhibit the development process of one (?) of your games, as you also explore and exhibit the development process of (your) games. In this sense, your work has always been important for Devolution (sorry I got used the use this term for everything related to understanding the development process, but I mean it in a very broad sense), has been crucial in helping us along the way with ideas and inspiration. [Games as Research](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/), [The Stuff Games Are Made Of](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262546119/the-stuff-games-are-made-of/), obviously.

I'm a bit afraid of too much meta-ness, thinking about thinking, exploring explorations, exhibiting exhibitions... but I think we can manage, I just felt I had to mention it once. 

Sorry to start so early with some organisational questions, but we only have 4 months for all this.

Should we focus on the exhibition/ exploration of one of your already finished (whatever that means) games? Which one (well known, last, well preserved/ documented?)?  
Do you maybe have something that is not already on [GitHub](https://github.com/pippinbarr?tab=repositories)?  
Or do we want to showcase one of your ongoing research/development processes? Are you currently working on something that could be included here? Will you still be working on it during [A MAZE. / Berlin 2025](https://2025.amaze-berlin.de/)? Show how you work, think, search directly in the exhibition, live.  
Or any other ideas?

Looking forward to all this!
Looking forward to whatever you think!

Saw the invitation to this repo in the morning and immediately though *what a good idea*. I love it. Text is more my thing than anything as well - maybe I'm suspicious of my voice too... almost seems like a glamorous paranoia.

Just about to have to make lunch and then devote some time to projects so this is the right moment to quickly get back to you I think.

In short, I think any of the paths you mention can work, but I definitely have this ongoing desire to have it be an *in progress* project in the sense that it might be possible that I could still be working on it when A MAZE rolls around (though frankly ideally not). But even just having worked on a project *with this exhibition in mind* is funny and meta.

So yeah, I just started a project I'm calling *It is as if you were on your phone* which is another installment of my series of speculative future applications along with *It is as if you were playing chess*, *It is as if you were doing work*, and *It is as if you were making love*. This one kind of returns to the chess idea but in a much more generalized sense: it's a simulator of being on your phone. Swiping, tapping, frowing, smirking, mostly being deadfaced. I have this idea (in the docs) that it's this repeated turnaround... the app exists as a kind of cover when you're in public: you look like a nice normal person on their phone. But it's actually a meditative aid, because you're *not* on your phone, you just performing the (soothing?) ritualistic gestures. But actually you *are* on your phone in the end, because... you're on your phone.

I won't go into depth because that's what the game's repo is for, but it might be a fun one. There's a chance it'll be an extended project, too, because I want to make its fraternal twin *It is as if you were on your computer* to go along with it, with the same framework but different base interactions and presumed context. Kind of an "anti boss hotkey" in way?

Anyway it would be my institive preference, but it's subject to a couple of concerns:

- What if I burn out or bore out and don't finish?
- What if it's not very good? (I mean, I'm going to try but who can say this early on)
- What if it's really frustrating for you and us to work on exhibiting something that's perpetually in some kind of flux in realtime?

What do you reckon? I finished *Let's Snake: Ancient Greek Punishment* recently, which is quite well documented, self-contained, fairly amusing...?
