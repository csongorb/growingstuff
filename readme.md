## Structure / Elements

- a physical [exhibition](./exhibition/) in the core, at [A MAZE./Berlin](https://2025.amaze-berlin.de/) (May 14 - 17 2025), consisting of:
    - exhibited [in-between versions](./versions/) of the *It is as if you were...* games
    - an limited edition eight-[booklets](./booklets/) bundle
    - some accompanying [live events](./onstage/)
- and a brief intro online at [devolution.online/itisasifyouwere](https://devolution.online/itisasifyouwere/)

### Process Documentation

Is the process documentation not part of the project? Yes, it is.

- so I suppose just look at this [conversation](/process/readme.md) between Pippin and Csongor to start
- or just look around in the reposutiry to encounter more and more in-depth reflections and documentations
- read the [commit history](https://github.com/csongorb/growingstuff/commits/main/)

### Orga

Additionally, the the exhibition was organised through:

- a [Miro board](./process/screenshots/)
- a Discord server
