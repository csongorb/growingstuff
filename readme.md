## Structure

- a physical exhibition, at [A MAZE./Berlin](https://2025.amaze-berlin.de/), May 14 - 17 2025
	- a tool ([Devolutionizer](https://github.com/csongorb/devolutionizer/commits/master/), sorry for the name) to exhibit the games / versions
- some [booklets](booklets/)
- some [live events](onstage/)
- this repository (?)

Very maybe we may will have some elements [online](https://devolution.online).

We organise ourselves through:

- some Miro boards
- a Discord server

## Documentation

- a [process documentation](process/)
- the [commit history](https://github.com/csongorb/growingstuff/commits/main/) of this repository
